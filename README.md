## How to Contribute

 - To **contribute a new specification**, use the [spec-container](https://www.github.com/openschemas/spec-container) as a template! You will just need to fork the repository, generate some text (tsv) files, and then connect to continuous integration to do the work for you. The resulting content generated by the continuous integration can then contributed here.
 - To **update a specification**, you should find the repository it is maintained in (for example, the Container* namespace is maintained in [spec-container](https://www.github.com/openschemas/spec-container) and then re-generate the updated files, and again pull request here.
