## How to Contribute
Note that we are currently 
[working on a validator](https://github.com/openschemas/openschemas-python/pull/7) 
so that submissions are validated before any pull request is merged. Gotta catch those bugs! :bugs:
Instructions below still hold true:

 - To **contribute a new specification**, use the [spec-template](https://www.github.com/openschemas/spec-template)
as a template! If you would like to see a fully connected, working example of this template, please
see the [spec-container](https://www.github.com/openschemas/spec-container) repository. 
You will just need to fork the template repository, generate some text (tsv) files, 
and then connect to continuous integration to do the work for you. The resulting 
content generated by the continuous integration can then contributed here.
 - To **update a specification**, you should find the repository it is maintained 
in (for example, the Container* namespace is maintained in 
[spec-container](https://www.github.com/openschemas/spec-container) and then 
re-generate the updated files, and again pull request here. You **could** just update
the file here, but we want changes to be represented in the base development location,
which is definitely the repository where the *.html file with frontend matter was
programatically generated.

Have any questions? Please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://www.github.com/openschemas/specifications/issues).
