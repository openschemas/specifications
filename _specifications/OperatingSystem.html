  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing
    many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See <a href="http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg">background
